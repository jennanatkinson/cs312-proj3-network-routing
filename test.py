#Tests for computeShortestPaths()

# Test single node as start node and end node
#def should_returnZero_when_singleNode():


# Test two nodes, one as start and one as end

# Test two nodes with no path between them

# Test three nodes, with the single edge to dest being larger, but the two combined edges being smaller

# Test example from slides
